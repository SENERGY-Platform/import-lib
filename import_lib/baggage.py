    Parse the OpenTelemetry baggage import-deploy hands over in BAGGAGE.

    The value is a W3C baggage header rather than JSON, because it is what the
    propagator on the other side produces and what an import would have to send on
    to carry the context into a request of its own.

        baggage-string = list-member *( OWS "," OWS list-member )
        list-member    = key OWS "=" OWS value *( OWS ";" OWS property )

    The properties a member may carry are dropped: nothing in the platform sets
    them, and they are metadata about an entry rather than context to log.

    A malformed entry is skipped rather than raised on. The baggage exists so that
    logs can be correlated; an import that refused to start over an unparseable
    annotation would trade a diagnostic aid for missing data.
